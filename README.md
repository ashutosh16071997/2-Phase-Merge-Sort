# 2-Phase-Merge-Sort
The following Code has two parts.
Sorting and Merging of 2 or more intermediate files when **The space in the main memory is less than the file size**.
Thus various **intermediate files** are formed just to sort intermediately and then merge them into one output file.
The project is implemented using 2 phase- **One is the sorting of intermediate files and other is the merging of these intermediate into one**
They are 2 files- 
**Sort.py** - Splitting and merging using using threads
**Sort1.py** - Splitting and merging using the concept of threads
